        <div>
          <p>Kenneth Lantz was born to Karen and Kenneth Lantz Sr. in 1964. He was born and raised in the Omaha area. He went on to spend most of his life working hard to support his children and build the life he wanted for his family. He’s always had an appreciation for eclectic music, vintage vehicles, and dogs that love as fiercely as he does. He spent some time in the United States Army and has never lost that structured work ethic. He worked hard to become a concrete truck driver — a stable job that kept him close to home and offered the ability to support his family. He has two loving pit bulls, a restored camper, and the bass line to every great funk groove etched into his brain. He lives life with loyalty, and does his best to pass down those values to his kids.</p>
